Built and compared multiple machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Neural Networks) to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using the MNIST dataset.

Conducted data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix.

Selected the best-performing model for deployment based on precision, recall, and F1-score.
